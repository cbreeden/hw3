# Exercise 7

Using Gillespie's algoirthm, simulate and plot a single trajectory of

$$
  S_1 + S_2 \mathrel{\mathop{\leftrightharpoons}\limits_1^{0.1}} S_3,
$$

up to time $T = 2$ under the assumption that $S_1(0) = 15$, $S_2(0) = 20$, and $S_3(0) = 0$.  Find a 95% confidence interval for $E[X_3(2)]$ using 1,000 independent simulations of the process.

## Setup

With this reaction network we have the intensity functions:

\begin{align*}
  \lambda_1(x) = x_1x_2 & \quad \text{for $S_1 + S_2 \mathrel{\mathop{\rightharpoonup}\limits^1} S_3$}, \\
  \lambda_2(x) = \frac{1}{10}x_3 & \quad \text{for $\phantom{S_1 +\ }\,S_3 \mathrel{\mathop{\rightharpoonup}\limits^{0.1}} S_1 + S_2$},
\end{align*}

and the reaction vectors

$$
  \xi_1 = (-1, -1, 1), \quad \xi_2 = (1, 1, -1).
$$

# Exercise 8

Using the next reaction method, simulate and plot a single trajectory of the model in Example 6.3 with $\kappa_1 = 200$, $\kappa_2 = 10$, $d_M = 25$, $d_p = 1$, an initial condition of 1 gene, 10 mRNA, and 50 protein molecules, and a terminal time of $T = 8$.

This model yields the four reaction vectors:
$$
\xi_1 = (0,1,0),\ \xi_2 = (0,0,1),\ \xi_3 = (0,-1,0),\ \xi_4 = (0,0,-1).
$$

# Exercise 11

Let

$$
\xi_1 = (-1, 1, 0) \ \text{and}\ \xi_2 = (0, -1, 1),
$$

and let $X^\theta_n$ be a discrete time Markov chain on $\mathbb{Z}^3_{\geq 0}$ with the following transition probabilities:

\begin{align}
p_{\vec x, \vec x + \xi_1} &= \frac{\theta xy}{\theta xy + y} \\
p_{\vec x, \vec x + \xi_2} &= 1 - p_1(x,y,z),
\end{align}

Assume that $X^\theta_0 = (100, 5, 0)$ and $\theta = 0.05$.  Let $f(X^\theta) = \left(X^\theta_1\right)_{100}$; that is the first component of the process after 100 steps.  We estimate $\frac{d}{d\theta} E\left[f(X^\theta)\right]$ using a number of different techniques.

## Finite Difference Method (Common Random Variables)

In this problem, we employ a centered finite difference method using the estimator

$$
\Delta^{\theta, h}_k
      = \frac{f(X^{\theta + h/2}_k) - f(X^{\theta - h/2}_k)}{h}.
$$

After taking a number of simulation, we will take the sample average

$$
\mu^{\theta, h} = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{k=0}^{N} \Delta^{\theta, h}_k.
$$

In an attempt to reduce the variance, we employ the common random variables technique; in which we will use the same sequence of uniform random variables when generating relizations $X^{\theta + h/2}_k$ and $X^{\theta - h/2}_k$.  We took $n = 10,000$ samples and obtained the following results for various $h$.


   h       $\mu^{\theta, h}$             $\sigma^2$        Confidence
-------  --------------------------    ---------------    ------------
0.01      -306.59                         18,230.86          2.56
0.005     -304.76                         36,782.56          3.76
0.001     -296.61                        215,947.83          9.11
0.0005    -298.46                        507,757.71         13.97

## Finite Difference Method (Independent Random Variables)

Out of curiosity, I also tried employing the algorithm without using a common sequence of uniform random variables for constructing relaizations of $X^{\theta + h/2}_k$ and $X^{\theta - h/2}_k$.  The results were astonishing; the variance increased by upto a factor of 10.  The following results were taking from $n = 10,000$ simulations.


   h       $\mu^{\theta, h}$             $\sigma^2$        Confidence
-------  --------------------------    ---------------    ------------
0.01      -312.09                          246,520             9.73
0.005     -314.66                          991,336            19.51
0.001     -339.00                        24,931,389           97.87
0.0005    -417.40                        99,077,950          195.09

## Likelihood Ratio Method

For likelihood ratio method, we took $n = 100,000$ samples.

   $\hat Y^{\theta}$            $\sigma^2$          Confidence
----------------------     ----------------     ----------------
      -331.29                  564,0541.81            46.55

While emplying a control variate with the weight function obtained using the Likelihood Ratio method, we had a dramatic reduction in variance.

  $\hat Y^\theta$              $\sigma^2$          Confidence
----------------------    ------------------    -----------------
      -302.56                   190,379.28             8.55
